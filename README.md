Some Gobang games with very high Artificial Intelligence

- Gobang in ASM:

  - A Gobang game written in x86 assembly.<br/>
  - It supports inter-computer games and can show a countdown timer in the nixie tubes. <br/>
  - The chessboard will be displayed both in the screen and an LED matrix.<br/>

- Gobang in Command Promp:

  - A Gobang game written in C++.<br/>
  - It runs in the Command Mode but still supports Mouse clicks because I wrote some codes about the Windows API and hook functions.<br/>
  - This game includes a very high AI. It won the 8th place in the [campus competition](http://www.botzone.org/RATE/resultview?contestid=115), which is the best result for 1-st year students.<br/>
  - <b>Ill-formatted because it was written when I was a freshman.</b>

- Gobang with GUI:

  - A Gobang game written in C#, with full network support.<br/>
  - The white side is the server and the black is the client.<br/>
  - Players can input the IP of the opposite side to play Gobang online.<br/>
  - Players can also save and load the games or replay completed games.
