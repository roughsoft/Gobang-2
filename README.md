Some Gobang games with very high Aritificial Intelligence

- In the Gobang in ASM directory:

  A Gobang game written in x86 assembly.<br/>
  It supports inter-computer games and can show a countdown timer in the nixie tubes. <br/>
  The chessboard will be displayed both in the screen and an LED matrix.<br/>

- In the Gobang in Command Prompt directory:

  A Gobang game written in C++.<br/>
  It runs in the Command Mode but still supports Mouse clicks because I wrote some codes about the Windows API and hook functions.<br/>
  This game includes a very high AI. It wons the 8th place in the [campus competition](http://www.botzone.org/RATE/resultview?contestid=115), which is the best result for 1-st year students.<br/>

- In the Gobang with GUI directory:

  A Gobang game written in C#, with the full network support.<br/>
  The white chessman is the server and the black is the client.<br/>
  Players can input the IP of the opposite side to play Gobang online.<br/>
